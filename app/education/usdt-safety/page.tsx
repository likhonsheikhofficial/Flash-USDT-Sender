          <p>
            <strong className="text-red-600">
              These claims are false and technically impossible. Any service making such claims is fraudulent.

          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "Flash loans" are a legitimate DeFi concept that's completely different from "Flash USDT" scams. Flash loans
            are uncollateralized loans where borrowing and repayment must occur within a single blockchain transaction.
            They're used by developers and traders for arbitrage, collateral swaps, and other advanced strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Flash loans don't create new tokens and require significant technical knowledge
            to implement. They're not a way to generate free cryptocurrency.

              <p>
                No. "Flash USDT" is not a legitimate cryptocurrency and is not listed on any reputable exchange like
                Binance. Legitimate exchanges only list verified cryptocurrencies. Binance and other major exchanges
                only offer legitimate USDT (Tether).

            <CardContent>
              <p>
                No. Since "Flash USDT" is not legitimate, it cannot be withdrawn to real bank accounts or traded on
                legitimate exchanges. Any service claiming otherwise is attempting to scam you. Only properly acquired
                legitimate USDT can be traded or withdrawn.

            </CardHeader>
            <CardContent>
              <p>
                Legitimate USDT (Tether) is one of the most widely used stablecoins, but it does carry risks like any
                cryptocurrency. Tether Limited claims that each USDT token is backed by assets in their reserves, though
                there have been controversies regarding the exact nature of these reserves. It's important to do your
                own research and understand the risks before investing in any cryptocurrency.

              <CardTitle>What's the difference between USDT on different networks?</CardTitle>
            </CardHeader>
            <CardContent>
              <p>
                USDT exists on multiple blockchain networks including Ethereum (ERC20), Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), and
                Tron (TRC20). The value is the same across all networks, but transaction fees and processing times vary.
                For example, TRC20 USDT typically has lower fees than ERC20 USDT. When transferring USDT, it's important
                to use the correct network to avoid losing funds.
